#This file gives some summary info about the masking, total, by class and by family
#(all repeats are detailed in the file RepeatMasker/Colletotrichum.sorted.fasta.out.parseRM.all-repeats.tab)
#Overlap or double corresponds to DNA fragments that are masked by several elements.
#These amounts need to be subtracted in order to get more accurate TE amount.
#If a .align file was parsed, these amounts will be much higher than for the associated .out
#Note that overlaps may not be parsed correctly if names are not formatted consistently (Rname#Rclass/Rfam)
